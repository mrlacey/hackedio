Huesical Lights
===============

A simple little app created for http://hacked.io/ (July 2013)

It's a WP8 app that controls Philips Hue bulbs to create a light show based on the artwork of the currently playing song.

THe speed of playback is controlled by shaking (or not) when the metronome button is pressed. If shaken while depressed then it goes faster. If hold down and not shake the speed of light change slows.
